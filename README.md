# farmer_registration_web_project

This project is a simple, front-end web application aimed at collecting and displaying detailed crop and personal information of farmers in a structured and printable format. It includes:

🌐 A responsive login interface (new_login.html)

📋 A multi-step form (shetkari.html, 2nd.html) for collecting personal, farm, and irrigation details

🧾 A summary print page (final.html) that displays all entered information in a formatted, printable layout

🎨 Basic but clean CSS styling (1st.css) and form validation

💾 Uses LocalStorage to retain data across pages without a backend

Ideal for use in rural digital literacy projects or as a base for larger agri-tech applications.
